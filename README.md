# CFML Utils for Vim
CFML Utils for Vim was born out of the frustration with trying to write
modern CFML in Vim. Existing versions of the cf.vim syntax file don't
support things like script based CFCs.

With CFML Utils, I also wanted to turn give Vim some basic functions
found in ColdFusion Builder extensions. Things like the QueryParam
Scanner and VarScoper extensions are awesome features and make debugging
legacy (or poorly written code) a breeze. In future versions of CFML
Utils, I also want to add basic RDS support to make general debugging
easier in Vim.

## Roadmap

### Phase 1:
Phase 1 of CFML Utils will just be a far better and more modern syntax
file for CFML editing in Vim. It will include full CFML support
including script based CFCs and tab completiong.

### Phase 2:
Phase 2 will include some CF Builder (like) extensions written purely in
Vim like the QueryParam Scanner and Var Scoper extension... pretty much
any extensions that I feel will make my life easier.

### Phase 3:
Phase 3 will include support to run CF code as a Vim plugin to add full
extension support like CF Builder.
